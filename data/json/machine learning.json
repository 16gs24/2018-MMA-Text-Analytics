                our data scientists discuss their passion and careers\n\n this video series shows the many faces of data science at deloitte, from data modelers to analytics enthusiasts, and why they chose a career with us. \n\nthe faces of data science at deloittewhat are data scientists like? they\u2019re as unique and varied as the stories they tell with data. the truth is, there\u2019s no single type of data scientist. our data science professionals have an array of interests and passions that attracted them to the field, and they are empowered to create their own paths forward.here are some of the data scientists that call deloitte home:the data science thrill-seekermany children dream of riding the roller coasters at disneyworld\u2014but not many dream of taking the plunge into the world of data science as a career. one consultant began to think of a career in data science after a talk on analytics by disney's head of operations research. learning about the inner workings of disneyworld sparked an interest and led to a career in data science at deloitte.the data science numbers loverto some of us, numbers are numbers. but to one deloitte manager, it was that first college statistics class that hooked her on everything data. the idea that data can make meaning of the world was something so intriguing that it became a quest, a passion, and ultimately a career.the data science super modelersometimes, data scientists enter the field because they've already dabbled in data in a related discipline. that's the case for one of our data science consultants who studied computer science, then entered the workforce supporting analytics implementations. a fascination with building data models led to an interest in predictive modeling and data mining.helping people was a source of inspiration for one analyst. the ability to build models that could turn volumes of data into insights, approaches, and solutions that could help many people was too powerful to ignore.\nread more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperspectives\n\nend users and data everywhere\n\n                                        \n                                            part 1: cloud and

get answers from kris hammond, deloitte\u2019s chief scientist. \n\nsurrounded by a wealth of data that\u2019s growing all the time, we look to machines to make sense of it. natural language generation is part of a larger ecosystem in artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and analytics that helps us turn data into facts and draw important conclusions from those facts. this is how we can make data highly useful and highly relevant in a contextual way. learn how natural language generation takes facts that machines can understand and turns them into a language that humans can

machine, can replicate.you might think that mobile device security risks are rising. after all, global workers are venturing far outside old corporate firewalls. from the ballpark to the beach, they\u2019re using their own smartphones and tablets to copy and forward proprietary documents and spreadsheets. and much of this data is stored on cloud computers belonging to other companies. add it all up, and it may appear as though corporations have utterly lost control of their secrets.security companies stress these risks and the need for security in their marketing. \u201cbut we\u2019re not

                our data scientists discuss their passion and careers\n\n this video series shows the many faces of data science at deloitte, from data modelers to analytics enthusiasts, and why they chose a career with us. \n\nthe faces of data science at deloittewhat are data scientists like? they\u2019re as unique and varied as the stories they tell with data. the truth is, there\u2019s no single type of data scientist. our data science professionals have an array of interests and passions that attracted them to the field, and they are empowered to create their own paths forward.here are some of the data scientists that call deloitte home:the data science thrill-seekermany children dream of riding the roller coasters at disneyworld\u2014but not many dream of taking the plunge into the world of data science as a career. one consultant began to think of a career in data science after a talk on analytics by disney's head of operations research. learning about the inner workings of disneyworld sparked an interest and led to a career in data science at deloitte.the data science numbers loverto some of us, numbers are numbers. but to one deloitte manager, it was that first college statistics class that hooked her on everything data. the idea that data can make meaning of the world was something so intriguing that it became a quest, a passion, and ultimately a career.the data science super modelersometimes, data scientists enter the field because they've already dabbled in data in a related discipline. that's the case for one of our data science consultants who studied computer science, then entered the workforce supporting analytics implementations. a fascination with building data models led to an interest in predictive modeling and data mining.helping people was a source of inspiration for one analyst. the ability to build models that could turn volumes of data into insights, approaches, and solutions that could help many people was too powerful to ignore.\nread more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperspectives\n\nend users and data everywhere\n\n                                        \n                                            part 1: cloud and infrastructure article series\n\n legacy data centers are falling farther and farther behind as the adoption of cloud computing contributes to better mobile end-user experiences. \n\nwidespread adoption of cloud computing and the evolution of the end-user experience are dramatically changing the corporate office. end users are on the move on different devices\u2014and so is end-user data. as customer and enterprise data moves across both internal and external telephony and wireless networks, cios are facing growing challenges around control and management of enterprise it and data flow to and from the data center (which may now be external).\nread more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperspectives\n\nnatural language generation and data science\n\n                                        \n                                            interview with kris hammond, chief scientist, narrative science\n\n what is natural language generation, what should clients be doing about nlg, and what is its future? get answers from kris hammond, deloitte\u2019s chief scientist. \n\nsurrounded by a wealth of data that\u2019s growing all the time, we look to machines to make sense of it. natural language generation is part of a larger ecosystem in artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and analytics that helps us turn data into facts and draw important conclusions from those facts. this is how we can make data highly useful and highly relevant in a contextual way. learn how natural language generation takes facts that machines can understand and turns them into a language that humans can process and act upon.\u200b\nread more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperspectives\n\nmobile device security risks: keeping data safe\n\n                                        \n                                            corporate cybersecurity in a mobile world\n\n security of data for mobile devices is a key concern for corporations and individuals. what potential mobile device security risks could you be facing? \n\nrisks and opportunities\u200bwho are you? the computer wants to know. convincing the machine you are who you claim to be is at the heart of network security. for the vast majority of us\u2014those committed to safeguarding bank accounts, personal data, corporate patents, and inside information\u2014security of data hinges on establishing our identity in a way that no one, man or machine, can replicate.you might think that mobile device security risks are rising. after all, global workers are venturing far outside old corporate firewalls. from the ballpark to the beach, they\u2019re using their own smartphones and tablets to copy and forward proprietary documents and spreadsheets. and much of this data is stored on cloud computers belonging to other companies. add it all up, and it may appear as though corporations have utterly lost control of their secrets.security companies stress these risks and the need for security in their marketing. \u201cbut we\u2019re not simply at the mercy of the attackers,\u201d says  michael wyatt , managing director, deloitte   touche llp, and identity management solution leader in deloitte advisory\u2019s cyber risk services. in the end, wyatt says, smartphones in the hands of mobile workers may prove to be more secure than the old cubicle pc equipped and vetted by the tech department. \u201cthe developments that people associate with increased mobile device security risks also create opportunities for new solutions.\u201d\nread more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabout us\n\ndata privacy and security\n\n

the value in unstructured data. but unlike most tech companies, those original co-founders continue to be directly involved in the daily operations of the company as ceo, vp r&d and vp customer success. they've built adlib on three pillars of strength that measure our success:\n\nproduct innovation. we build up from our roots, improvising - adlibbing - solutions to client document and data

actually live them. how do we know this? a significant portion of our team has been here for longer than 10 years. in the tech industry, that's rare. we have people who leave and come back because they miss the culture and our team spirit.\nbut, having said that, we aren't perfect at everything. we're continuously working on change management - we've lost count of how many whiteboards we have. we don't have all of the processes we'd like to, but that means that this is the place to get your hands dirty, come up with your own processes and work without a net.\nwhile this might be common in

fresh fruit in the lunchroom and fitness membership reimbursement. our burlington, ontario location translates to minimal commute time and maximum family time and productivity time. if you aren't

to our suite of offerings, building a new product with a unique approach to data insights.\nlike most tech companies, adlib started small, in response to a problem our co-founders experienced as business leaders. they recognized a need for rapidly generated solutions to leverage the value in unstructured data. but unlike most tech companies, those original co-founders continue to be directly involved in the daily operations of the company as ceo, vp r&d and vp customer success. they've built adlib on three pillars of strength that measure our success:\n\nproduct innovation. we build up from our roots, improvising - adlibbing - solutions to client document and data management problems.\ncustomer relationships. we have a dedicated focus on creating a positive customer experience that stands out from everyone else.\ntruly engaged and passionate team. that's where you come in.\n\nwho you are\nyou are obsessed with solving big data problems and determining value of dark data. you

buzzwords used to attract attention, we actually live them. how do we know this? a significant portion of our team has been here for longer than 10 years. in the tech industry, that's rare. we have people who leave and come back because they miss the culture and our team spirit.\nbut, having said that, we aren't perfect at everything. we're continuously working on change management - we've lost count of how many whiteboards we have. we don't have all of the processes we'd like to, but that means that this is the place to get your hands dirty, come up with your own processes and work without a net.\nwhile this might be common in silicon valley, in the suburbs of toronto, it's rare and greatly appreciated to have an open-vacation policy and to promote employee wellness. we have massage therapist days, badminton, baseball, fresh fruit in the lunchroom and fitness membership reimbursement. our burlington, ontario location translates to minimal commute time and maximum family time and productivity time. if you aren't stuck in traffic, worried about being late for a professional or personal commitment, life is just less stressful and work is more enjoyable.\nadlib software is revolutionizing the way organizations think about their content, join us to be part of that change. apply now or follow us on\u00a0twitter,\u00a0facebook\u00a0or\u00a0linkedin.\nadlib seeks to inspire and nurture the human spirit - we understand that each person brings a distinct life experience to the table. embracing diversity not only enhances our work culture but drives business success. adlib
