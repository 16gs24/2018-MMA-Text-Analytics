for the\n    activities, omissions or other conduct of users. automotohr\n    acts as a portal for the online distribution and publication of user submitted\n    information and has no obligation to screen communications or information in\n    advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring documents posted by\n    users. if notified by a user of a document which allegedly does not conform to\n    these terms and conditions, automotohr may\n    investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole\n    discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such document. automotohr has no liability or responsibility to users for\n    performance or nonperformance of such activities. automotohr\n    may take any action with respect to user submitted information that it deems\n    necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion.\n\u00a0\n5.2 no endorsements\n    by automotohr. nothing on the talent network shall be\n    considered an endorsement, representation or warranty with respect to any user\n    or third party, whether in regards to its web site, products, services, hiring,\n    experience, employment or recruiting practices, or otherwise.\n\u00a0\n5.3 warranty\n        disclaimers.\n\u00a0\n(a) the talent network is provided on an 'as is' basis\n    without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. automotohr, to the\n    fullest extent permitted by law, disclaims all warranties, including, but not\n    limited to, the warranties of merchantability, title, non-infringement of third\n    parties\u2019 rights, and fitness for particular purpose. automotohr makes no\n    warranties about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the\n    talent network.\n\u00a0\n(b) without limitation on the foregoing:\n\u00a0\n(i) automotohr does not warrant\n    that the talent network will operate error-free or that the talent network and\n    its servers are free of computer viruses or other harmful mechanisms. if your\n    use of the talent network results directly or indirectly in the need for servicing\n    or replacing equipment or data, automotohr is not responsible for those costs.\n\u00a0\n(ii) automotohr makes no representations or guarantees\n    regarding the truthfulness, accuracy, legality, completeness, timeliness or\n    reliability of any documents posted by users, or of any other form of\n    communication engaged in by users. documents may contain inaccuracies or\n    typographical errors. you agree that any reliance on documents posted by users,\n    or on any other form of communication with users, will be at your own risk.\n\u00a0\n(iii) automotohr makes no representations or guarantees\n    regarding the content of the talent network,

or\n    timeliness of the services in meeting your employment objectives. automotohr    does not guarantee that the services will result in candidates being hired,\n    positions being filled or employees being retained, and is not responsible or\n    liable for any business, employment, hiring and/or salary decisions, for\n    whatever reason made, made by you.\n\u00a0\n5.4 damage limitations, allocations of liability and\n    equitable relief.\n\u00a0\n(a) you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of\n    the talent network, the internet generally, and the documents you post or\n    access and for your conduct on and off the talent network.\n\u00a0\n(b) in no event shall automotohr (or any of its officers,\n    directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or advertisers),\n    be liable for any non-direct damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,\n    incidental and consequential damages, lost profits, or damages resulting from\n    lost data, lost employment opportunity, or business interruption) resulting\n    from or arising under or in connection with services or the use or access to,\n    or the inability to use or access, the talent network and/or any document,\n    whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and\n    whether or not automotohr is advised of the possibility of such damages. this\n    section shall not apply to any payment and indemnification obligations\n    described herein.\n\u00a0\n(c) because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the\n    exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,\n    the limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph may not apply to you. if\n    any are held inapplicable or unenforceable for any reason, then automotohr    maximum liability to you for any non-direct type of damages shall be limited to\n    u.s. $200.00 in the aggregate.\n\u00a0\n(d) in no event shall automotohr (or any of its officers,\n    directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or\n    advertisers), be liable for any direct damages in excess in the aggregate of\n    us$200.00.\n\u00a0\n(e) due to the nature of this agreement, in addition to\n    money damages, you agree that automotohr will be entitled to equitable relief\n    upon a breach of this agreement by you.\n\u00a0\n5.5 user\n        authentication. because user authentication on the internet is difficult, automotohr cannot and does not confirm that each user is\n    who they claim to be. because automotohr does not and\n    cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings or control the behavior of\n    participants on the talent network, in the event that you have a dispute with\n    one or more users, you release automotohr from\n    claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect)\n    of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected,\n    disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such\n    disputes.\n\u00a0\n5.6 california\n        residents. if you are a california resident, you waive california civil\n    code section 1542, which says: \"a general release does not extend to\n    claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor\n    at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have\n    materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.\"\n\u00a0\n6. links to other\n        sites. the talent network may contain links to third party web sites. these\n    links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by automotohr of the contents on such third-party web sites. automotohr is not responsible for the content of linked\n    third-party sites and does not make any representations regarding the content\n    or accuracy of materials on such third-party web sites. if you decide to access\n    linked third-party web sites, you do so at your own risk.\n\u00a0\n7. amendments to this\n        agreement and changes to the talent network. automotohr\n    may revise these terms and conditions at any time by updating this page.\n    changes will be binding on you on the date they are posted on the talent\n    network (or as otherwise stated in any notice of such changes). any use of the\n    talent network will be considered acceptance by you of the then-current terms\n    and conditions (including any exhibits thereto) contained on such talent\n    network. if at any time you find the terms and conditions unacceptable, you\n    must not use the applicable talent network any longer. any new or different\n    terms supplied by you are specifically rejected by automotohr\n    unless automotohr agrees to them in a signed writing\n    specifically including those new or different terms. automotohr\n    may change the talent network at any time.\n\u00a0\n8. indemnity. you\n    agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless automotohr\n    (and its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries,\n    affiliates, agents or advertisers) from and against any third party claims,\n    actions or demands (including, without limitation, costs, damages and\n    reasonable legal and accounting fees) alleging or resulting from or in\n    connection with your use of the talent network, any document posted by you,\n    your use of the services or your breach of this agreement. automotohr\n    shall use reasonable efforts to provide you prompt\n    notice of any such claim, suit, or proceeding and may assist you, at your\n    expense, in defending any such claim, suit or proceeding.\n\u00a0\n9. user information and privacy\n            policy.\n\u00a0\n9.1 when you register\n        on the talent network or in connection with the services, you will be asked\n    to create an account and provide automotohr with\n    certain information, including but not limited to, a valid email address (\u201cuser\n    information\u201d). you acknowledge and agree that you have no ownership rights in\n    your account.\n\u00a0\n9.2 all user\n        information will be used in accordance with the terms of the talent network\n    privacy policy. please note, as set forth in the privacy policy, that automotohr may collect certain user information (including\n    an email address and other contact information) and may use such information to\n    contact users periodically in accordance with the terms of the privacy policy,\n    including to send users electronic marketing and promotional communications,\n    inform users of relevant job postings that may be of interest to them, and\n    provide users with administrative notices and communications. users can\n    withdraw their consent at any time from receiving marketing and promotional\n    communications from automotohr. in addition, as set\n    forth in the talent network privacy policy, automotohr\n    also will share your contact information (including your email address) with\n    the employer on whose behalf automotohr operates this\n    talent network. that employer may use your information to contact you directly,\n    including by email, at the contact information you have provided. in addition, automotohr reserves the right to comply, in its sole\n    discretion, with legal requirements, requests from law enforcement agencies or\n    requests from government entities, even to the extent that such compliance may\n    require disclosure of certain user information. in addition, third parties may\n    retain cached copies of user information.\n\u00a0\n10. questions and notices.\n    questions concerning the use of the talent network should be directed to\n    feedback. notices to automotohr should be sent to the\n    address listed on the talent network. we will send notice to you at the address\n    submitted by you or to such other address as automotohr\n    reasonably determines is an appropriate address for you.\n\u00a0\n11. general. automotohr contact information is listed on the talent\n    network. automotohr makes no claims that the content\n    is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the united states. access to the\n    content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries, and such\n    persons have no right to access or use the talent network. if you access the\n    talent network from outside of the united states, you do so at your own risk\n    and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. this\n    agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws of the state of\n    california, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. jurisdiction\n    for any claims arising under this agreement or your service activation\n    agreement shall lie exclusively with the state or federal courts in the state\n    of california. the sole relationship between you and automotohr\n    is that of independent contractors. if any provision of this agreement is found\n    to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of all\n    or part of a provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts and\n    provisions of this agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. all\n    provisions of this agreement shall survive termination except those granting\n    access or use to the talent network, and you shall cease all your use and\n    access thereof immediately. you may not assign or transfer your obligations\n    under this agreement. no waiver of any term of this agreement shall be deemed a\n    further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. except as\n    expressly provided by automotohr in a particular\n    \"legal notice,\" or material on particular web pages of the talent\n    network, this agreement and your service activation agreement where applicable,\n    constitute the entire agreement between you and automotohr.\n\u00a0\n12. rules regarding posting, conduct\n            and security.\n\u00a0\nthe following rules apply to your use of the talent network\n    and/or the services. the list of

and peeling back all the layers. \u00a0finding new questions to you is almost as fun as answering them, but answer them you do, with solid statistical proof displayed in clear language and compelling visualizations. the second requirement is an ability and interest in understanding our business. \u00a0\u00a0we\u2019ve got lots of data, but it\u2019s not going to turn itself into information, and you can\u2019t help with that unless you understand what the numbers mean. \u00a0learning about our business will be made both easy and fun by your deep and passionate love of the internet. \u00a0you believe it\u2019s powerfully transformative and even, perhaps, the greatest thing ever. \u00a0you can\u2019t wait to be a part of helping tucows make the internet even more awesome. the third component is that you really, for serious\u00ad, love math and coding. your arsenal of algorithms is both deep and broad. \u00a0you know precisely which tool is right for the job and you also know why.the last, but certainly not least, component is the ability and willingness to continuously learn about new technologies. the data science ecosystem is a fast-evolving beast. newer and more powerful tools are released all the time. you are a data scientist who is constantly updating their knowledge of data science state-of-the-art.if you have these four qualities, you\u2019ll find tucows

screen communications or information in\n    advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring documents posted by\n    users. if notified by a user of a document which allegedly does not conform to\n    these terms and conditions, automotohr may\n    investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole\n    discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such document. automotohr has no liability or responsibility to users for\n    performance or nonperformance of such activities. automotohr\n    may take any action with respect to user submitted information that it deems\n    necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion.\n\u00a0\n5.2 no endorsements\n    by automotohr. nothing on the talent network shall be\n    considered an endorsement,

   fullest extent permitted by law, disclaims all warranties, including, but not\n    limited to, the warranties of merchantability, title, non-infringement of third\n    parties\u2019 rights, and fitness for particular purpose. automotohr makes no\n    warranties about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the\n    talent network.\n\u00a0\n(b) without limitation on the foregoing:\n\u00a0\n(i) automotohr does not warrant\n    that the talent network will operate error-free or that the talent network and\n    its servers are free of computer viruses or other harmful mechanisms. if your\n    use of the talent network results directly or indirectly in the need for servicing\n    or replacing equipment or data, automotohr is not responsible for those costs.\n\u00a0\n(ii) automotohr makes no representations or guarantees\n    regarding the truthfulness, accuracy, legality, completeness, timeliness or\n    reliability of any documents posted by users, or of any other form of\n    communication engaged in by users. documents may contain inaccuracies or\n    typographical errors. you agree that any reliance on documents posted by users,\n    or on any other form of communication with users, will be at your own risk.\n\u00a0\n(iii) automotohr makes no representations or guarantees\n    regarding the content of the talent network,

or\n    timeliness of the services in meeting your employment objectives. automotohr    does not guarantee that the services will result in candidates being hired,\n    positions being filled or employees being retained, and is not responsible or\n    liable for any business, employment, hiring and/or salary decisions, for\n    whatever reason made, made by you.\n\u00a0\n5.4 damage limitations, allocations of liability and\n    equitable relief.\n\u00a0\n(a) you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of\n    the talent network, the internet generally, and the documents you post or\n    access and for your conduct on and off the talent network.\n\u00a0\n(b) in no event shall automotohr (or any of its officers,\n    directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or advertisers),\n    be liable for any non-direct damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,\n    incidental and consequential damages, lost profits, or damages resulting from\n    lost data, lost employment opportunity, or business interruption) resulting\n    from or arising under or in connection with services or the use or access to,\n    or the inability to use or access, the talent network and/or any document,\n    whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and\n    whether or not automotohr is advised of the possibility of such damages. this\n    section shall not apply to any payment and indemnification obligations\n    described herein.\n\u00a0\n(c) because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the\n    exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,\n    the limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph may not apply to you. if\n    any are held inapplicable or unenforceable for

us$200.00.\n\u00a0\n(e) due to the nature of this agreement, in addition to\n    money damages, you agree that automotohr will be entitled to equitable relief\n    upon a breach of this agreement by you.\n\u00a0\n5.5 user\n        authentication. because user authentication on the internet is difficult, automotohr cannot and does not confirm that each user is\n    who they claim to be. because automotohr does not and\n    cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings or control the behavior of\n    participants on the talent network, in the event that you have a dispute with\n    one or more users, you release automotohr from\n    claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect)\n    of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected,\n    disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such\n    disputes.\n\u00a0\n5.6 california\n        residents. if you are a california resident, you waive california civil\n    code section 1542, which says: \"a general release does not extend to\n    claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor\n    at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have\n    materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.\"\n\u00a0\n6. links to other\n        sites. the talent network may contain links to third party web sites. these\n    links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by automotohr of the contents on such third-party web sites. automotohr is not responsible for the content of linked\n    third-party sites and does not make any representations regarding the content\n    or accuracy of materials on such third-party web sites. if you decide to access\n    linked third-party web sites, you do so at your own risk.\n\u00a0\n7. amendments to this\n        agreement and changes to the talent network. automotohr\n    may revise these terms and conditions at any

insights team. together, we\u2019re responsible for all of the reporting, analytics, data flows, visualization, machine learning and related business intelligence operations within the company. \u00a0success in this role requires four related components. \u00a0the first is that at your core, you are curious. \u00a0you live for going down the rabbit hole. chasing mysteries, finding quirks, and peeling back all the layers. \u00a0finding new questions to you is almost as fun as answering them, but answer them you do, with solid statistical proof displayed in clear language and compelling visualizations. the second requirement is an ability and interest in understanding our business. \u00a0\u00a0we\u2019ve got lots of data, but it\u2019s not going to turn itself into information, and you can\u2019t help with that unless you understand what the numbers mean. \u00a0learning about our business will be made both easy and fun by your deep and passionate love of the internet. \u00a0you believe it\u2019s powerfully transformative and even, perhaps, the greatest thing ever. \u00a0you can\u2019t wait to be a part of helping tucows make the internet even more awesome. the third component is that you really, for serious\u00ad, love math and coding. your arsenal of algorithms is both deep and broad. \u00a0you know precisely which tool is right for the job and you also know why.the last, but certainly not least, component is the ability and willingness to continuously learn about new technologies. the data science ecosystem is a fast-evolving beast. newer and more powerful tools are released all the time. you are a data scientist who is constantly updating their knowledge of data science state-of-the-art.if you have these four qualities, you\u2019ll find tucows
