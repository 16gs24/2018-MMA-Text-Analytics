chose a career with us. \n\nthe faces of data science at deloittewhat are data scientists like? they\u2019re as unique and varied as the stories they tell with data. the truth is, there\u2019s no single type of data scientist. our data science professionals have an array of interests and passions that attracted them to the field, and they are empowered to create their own paths forward.here are some of the data scientists that call deloitte home:the data science thrill-seekermany children dream of riding the roller coasters at disneyworld\u2014but not many dream of taking the plunge into the world of data science as a career. one consultant began to think of a career in data science after a talk on analytics by disney's head of operations research. learning about the inner workings of disneyworld sparked an interest and led to a career in data science at deloitte.the data science numbers loverto some of us, numbers are numbers. but to one deloitte manager, it was that first college statistics class that hooked her on everything data. the idea that data can make meaning of the world was something so intriguing that it became a quest, a passion, and ultimately a career.the data science super modelersometimes, data scientists enter the field because they've already dabbled in data in a related discipline. that's the case for one of our data science consultants who studied computer science, then entered the workforce supporting analytics implementations. a fascination with building data models led to an interest in predictive modeling and data mining.helping people was a source of inspiration for one analyst. the ability to build models that could turn volumes of data into insights, approaches, and solutions that could help many people was too powerful to ignore.\nread more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperspectives\n\nend users and data everywhere\n\n                                        \n                                            part 1: cloud and

adoption of cloud computing and the evolution of the end-user experience are dramatically changing the corporate office. end users are on the move on different devices\u2014and so is end-user data. as

get answers from kris hammond, deloitte\u2019s chief scientist. \n\nsurrounded by a wealth of data that\u2019s growing all the time, we look to machines to make sense of it. natural language generation is part of a larger ecosystem in artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and analytics that helps us turn data into facts and draw important conclusions from those facts. this is how we can make data highly useful and highly relevant in a contextual way. learn how natural language generation takes facts that machines can understand and turns them into a language that humans can

us\u2014those committed to safeguarding bank accounts, personal data, corporate patents, and inside information\u2014security of data hinges on establishing our identity in a way that no one, man or machine, can replicate.you might think that mobile device security risks are rising. after all, global workers are venturing far outside old corporate firewalls. from the ballpark to the beach, they\u2019re using their own smartphones and tablets to copy and forward proprietary documents and spreadsheets. and much of this data is stored on cloud computers belonging to other companies. add it all up, and it may appear as though corporations have utterly lost control of their secrets.security companies stress these risks and the need for security in their marketing. \u201cbut we\u2019re not simply at the mercy of the attackers,\u201d says  michael wyatt , managing director, deloitte   touche llp, and identity management solution leader in deloitte advisory\u2019s cyber risk services. in the end, wyatt says, smartphones in the hands of mobile workers may prove to be more secure than the old cubicle pc equipped and vetted by the tech department. \u201cthe developments that people

chose a career with us. \n\nthe faces of data science at deloittewhat are data scientists like? they\u2019re as unique and varied as the stories they tell with data. the truth is, there\u2019s no single type of data scientist. our data science professionals have an array of interests and passions that attracted them to the field, and they are empowered to create their own paths forward.here are some of the data scientists that call deloitte home:the data science thrill-seekermany children dream of riding the roller coasters at disneyworld\u2014but not many dream of taking the plunge into the world of data science as a career. one consultant began to think of a career in data science after a talk on analytics by disney's head of operations research. learning about the inner workings of disneyworld sparked an interest and led to a career in data science at deloitte.the data science numbers loverto some of us, numbers are numbers. but to one deloitte manager, it was that first college statistics class that hooked her on everything data. the idea that data can make meaning of the world was something so intriguing that it became a quest, a passion, and ultimately a career.the data science super modelersometimes, data scientists enter the field because they've already dabbled in data in a related discipline. that's the case for one of our data science consultants who studied computer science, then entered the workforce supporting analytics implementations. a fascination with building data models led to an interest in predictive modeling and data mining.helping people was a source of inspiration for one analyst. the ability to build models that could turn volumes of data into insights, approaches, and solutions that could help many people was too powerful to ignore.\nread more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperspectives\n\nend users and data everywhere\n\n                                        \n                                            part 1: cloud and

adoption of cloud computing and the evolution of the end-user experience are dramatically changing the corporate office. end users are on the move on different devices\u2014and so is end-user data. as

get answers from kris hammond, deloitte\u2019s chief scientist. \n\nsurrounded by a wealth of data that\u2019s growing all the time, we look to machines to make sense of it. natural language generation is part of a larger ecosystem in artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and analytics that helps us turn data into facts and draw important conclusions from those facts. this is how we can make data highly useful and highly relevant in a contextual way. learn how natural language generation takes facts that machines can understand and turns them into a language that humans can

facing? \n\nrisks and opportunities\u200bwho are you? the computer wants to know. convincing the machine you are who you claim to be is at the heart of network security. for the vast majority of us\u2014those committed to safeguarding bank accounts, personal data, corporate patents, and inside information\u2014security of data hinges on establishing our identity in a way that no one, man or machine, can replicate.you might think that mobile device security risks are rising. after all, global workers are venturing far outside old corporate firewalls. from the ballpark to the beach, they\u2019re using their own smartphones and tablets to copy and forward proprietary documents and spreadsheets. and much of this data is stored on cloud computers belonging to other companies. add it all up, and it may appear as though corporations have utterly lost control of their secrets.security companies stress these risks and the need for security in their marketing. \u201cbut we\u2019re not simply at the mercy of the attackers,\u201d says  michael wyatt , managing director, deloitte   touche llp, and identity management solution leader in deloitte advisory\u2019s cyber risk services. in the end, wyatt says, smartphones in the hands of mobile workers may prove to be more secure than the old cubicle pc equipped and vetted by the tech department. \u201cthe developments that people

second requirement is an ability and interest in understanding our business. \u00a0\u00a0we\u2019ve got lots of data, but it\u2019s not going to turn itself into information, and you can\u2019t help

really, for serious\u00ad, love math and coding. your arsenal of algorithms is both deep and broad. \u00a0you know precisely which tool is right for the job and you also know why.the last, but certainly not least, component is the ability and willingness to continuously learn about new technologies. the data science ecosystem is a fast-evolving beast. newer and more powerful tools are released all the time. you are a data scientist who is constantly updating their knowledge of data science state-of-the-art.if you have these four qualities, you\u2019ll find tucows an exciting,
