single type of data scientist. our data science professionals have an array of interests and passions that attracted them to the field, and they are empowered to create their own paths forward.here are some of the data scientists that call deloitte home:the data science thrill-seekermany children dream of riding the roller coasters at disneyworld\u2014but not many dream of taking the plunge into the world of data science as a career. one consultant began to think of a career in data science after a talk on analytics by disney's head of operations research. learning about the inner workings of disneyworld sparked an interest and led to a career in data science at deloitte.the data science numbers loverto some of us, numbers are numbers. but to one deloitte manager, it was that first college statistics class that hooked her on everything data. the idea that data can make meaning of the world was something so intriguing that it became a quest, a passion, and ultimately a career.the data science super modelersometimes, data scientists enter the field because they've already dabbled in data in a related discipline. that's the case for one of our data science consultants who studied computer science, then entered the workforce supporting analytics implementations. a fascination with building data models led to an interest in predictive modeling and data mining.helping people was a source of inspiration for one analyst. the ability to build models that could turn volumes of data into insights, approaches, and solutions that could help many people was too powerful to

get answers from kris hammond, deloitte\u2019s chief scientist. \n\nsurrounded by a wealth of data that\u2019s growing all the time, we look to machines to make sense of it. natural language generation is part of a larger ecosystem in artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and analytics that helps us turn data into facts and draw important conclusions from those facts. this is how we can make data highly useful and highly relevant in a contextual way. learn how natural language generation takes facts that machines can understand and turns them into a language that humans can

machine, can replicate.you might think that mobile device security risks are rising. after all, global workers are venturing far outside old corporate firewalls. from the ballpark to the beach, they\u2019re using their own smartphones and tablets to copy and forward proprietary documents and spreadsheets. and much of this data is stored on cloud computers belonging to other companies. add it all up, and it may appear as though corporations have utterly lost control of their secrets.security companies stress these risks and the need for security in their marketing. \u201cbut we\u2019re not

chose a career with us. \n\nthe faces of data science at deloittewhat are data scientists like? they\u2019re as unique and varied as the stories they tell with data. the truth is, there\u2019s no single type of data scientist. our data science professionals have an array of interests and passions that attracted them to the field, and they are empowered to create their own paths forward.here are some of the data scientists that call deloitte home:the data science thrill-seekermany children dream of riding the roller coasters at disneyworld\u2014but not many dream of taking the plunge into the world of data science as a career. one consultant began to think of a career in data science after a talk on analytics by disney's head of operations research. learning about the inner workings of disneyworld sparked an interest and led to a career in data science at deloitte.the data science numbers loverto some of us, numbers are numbers. but to one deloitte manager, it was that first college statistics class that hooked her on everything data. the idea that data can make meaning of the world was something so intriguing that it became a quest, a passion, and ultimately a career.the data science super modelersometimes, data scientists enter the field because they've already dabbled in data in a related discipline. that's the case for one of our data science consultants who studied computer science, then entered the workforce supporting analytics implementations. a fascination with building data models led to an interest in predictive modeling and data mining.helping people was a source of inspiration for one analyst. the ability to build models that could turn volumes of data into insights, approaches, and solutions that could help many people was too powerful to ignore.\nread more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperspectives\n\nend users and data everywhere\n\n                                        \n                                            part 1: cloud and

adoption of cloud computing and the evolution of the end-user experience are dramatically changing the corporate office. end users are on the move on different devices\u2014and so is end-user data. as

get answers from kris hammond, deloitte\u2019s chief scientist. \n\nsurrounded by a wealth of data that\u2019s growing all the time, we look to machines to make sense of it. natural language generation is part of a larger ecosystem in artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and analytics that helps us turn data into facts and draw important conclusions from those facts. this is how we can make data highly useful and highly relevant in a contextual way. learn how natural language generation takes facts that machines can understand and turns them into a language that humans can

us\u2014those committed to safeguarding bank accounts, personal data, corporate patents, and inside information\u2014security of data hinges on establishing our identity in a way that no one, man or machine, can replicate.you might think that mobile device security risks are rising. after all, global workers are venturing far outside old corporate firewalls. from the ballpark to the beach, they\u2019re using their own smartphones and tablets to copy and forward proprietary documents and spreadsheets. and much of this data is stored on cloud computers belonging to other companies. add it all up, and it may appear as though corporations have utterly lost control of their secrets.security companies stress these risks and the need for security in their marketing. \u201cbut we\u2019re not

insights.\nlike most tech companies, adlib started small, in response to a problem our co-founders experienced as business leaders. they recognized a need for rapidly generated solutions to leverage the value in unstructured data. but unlike most tech companies, those original co-founders continue to be directly involved in the daily operations of the company as ceo, vp r&d and vp customer success. they've built adlib on three pillars of strength that measure our success:\n\nproduct innovation. we build up from our roots, improvising - adlibbing - solutions to client document and data

you want to use research, natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve data science challenges. you want an opportunity to drive forward the creation of algorithms that will become part of the adlib elevate platform and have a significant impact on thousands of organizations across the globe. there are very few roles like this one out there.\nour new

actually live them. how do we know this? a significant portion of our team has been here for longer than 10 years. in the tech industry, that's rare. we have people who leave and come back because they miss the culture and our team spirit.\nbut, having said that, we aren't perfect at everything. we're continuously working on change management - we've lost count of how many whiteboards we have. we don't have all of the processes we'd like to, but that means that this is the place to get your hands dirty, come up with your own processes and work without a net.\nwhile this might be common in silicon valley, in the suburbs of toronto, it's rare and greatly appreciated to have an open-vacation policy and to promote employee wellness. we have massage therapist days, badminton, baseball, fresh fruit in the lunchroom and fitness membership reimbursement. our burlington, ontario location translates to minimal commute time and maximum family time and productivity time. if you aren't stuck in traffic, worried about being late for a professional or personal commitment, life is just less stressful and work is more enjoyable.\nadlib software is revolutionizing the way organizations think about their content, join us to be part of that change. apply now or follow us on\u00a0twitter,\u00a0facebook\u00a0or\u00a0linkedin.\nadlib seeks to inspire and nurture the human spirit - we

content management. we've displaced gorillas in the market with a focus on customer service and success. we are adding to our suite of offerings, building a new product with a unique approach to data insights.\nlike most tech companies, adlib started small, in response to a problem our co-founders experienced as business leaders. they recognized a need for rapidly generated solutions to leverage the value in unstructured data. but unlike most tech companies, those original co-founders continue to be directly involved in the daily operations of the company as ceo, vp r&d and vp customer success. they've built adlib on three pillars of strength that measure our success:\n\nproduct innovation. we build up from our roots, improvising - adlibbing - solutions to client document and data management problems.\ncustomer relationships. we have a dedicated focus on creating a positive customer experience that stands out from everyone else.\ntruly engaged and passionate team. that's where

you want to use research, natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve data science challenges. you want an opportunity to drive forward the creation of

actually live them. how do we know this? a significant portion of our team has been here for longer than 10 years. in the tech industry, that's rare. we have people who leave and come back because they miss the culture and our team spirit.\nbut, having said that, we aren't perfect at everything. we're continuously working on change management - we've lost count of how many whiteboards we have. we don't have all of the processes we'd like to, but that means that this is the place to get your hands dirty, come up with your own processes and work without a net.\nwhile this might be common in silicon valley, in the suburbs of toronto, it's rare and greatly appreciated to have an open-vacation policy and to promote employee wellness. we have massage therapist days, badminton, baseball, fresh fruit in the lunchroom and fitness membership reimbursement. our burlington, ontario location translates to minimal commute time and maximum family time and productivity time. if you aren't stuck in traffic, worried about being late for a professional or personal commitment, life is just less stressful and work is more enjoyable.\nadlib software is revolutionizing the way organizations think about their content, join us to be part of that change. apply now or follow us on\u00a0twitter,\u00a0facebook\u00a0or\u00a0linkedin.\nadlib seeks to inspire and nurture the human spirit - we understand that each person brings a distinct life experience to the table. embracing diversity not only enhances our work culture but drives business success. adlib encourages applications from everybody, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n

submitted\n    information and has no obligation to screen communications or information in\n    advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring documents posted by\n    users. if notified by a user of a document which allegedly does not conform to\n    these terms and conditions, automotohr may\n    investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole\n    discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such document. automotohr has no liability or responsibility to users for\n    performance or nonperformance of such activities. automotohr\n    may take any action with respect to user submitted information that it deems\n    necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion.\n\u00a0\n5.2 no endorsements\n    by automotohr. nothing on the talent

any kind, express or implied. automotohr, to the\n    fullest extent permitted by law, disclaims all warranties, including, but not\n    limited to, the warranties of merchantability, title, non-infringement of third\n    parties\u2019 rights, and fitness for particular purpose. automotohr makes no\n    warranties about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the\n    talent network.\n\u00a0\n(b) without limitation on the foregoing:\n\u00a0\n(i) automotohr does not warrant\n    that the talent network will operate error-free or that the talent network and\n    its servers are free of computer viruses or other harmful mechanisms. if your\n    use of the talent network results directly or indirectly in the need for servicing\n    or replacing equipment or data, automotohr is not responsible for those costs.\n\u00a0\n(ii) automotohr makes no representations or guarantees\n    regarding the truthfulness, accuracy, legality, completeness, timeliness or\n    reliability of any documents posted by users, or of any other form of\n    communication engaged in by users. documents may contain inaccuracies or\n    typographical errors. you agree that any reliance on documents posted by users,\n    or on any other form of communication with users, will be at your own risk.\n\u00a0\n(iii) automotohr makes no representations or guarantees\n    regarding the content of the talent network, including, but not limited to,\n    broken links, inaccuracies or typographical errors.\n\u00a0\n(iv) automotohr makes no\n    representations or guarantees regarding the effectiveness of the services or\n    timeliness of the services in meeting your employment objectives. automotohr    does not guarantee that the services will result in candidates being hired,\n    positions being filled or employees being retained, and is not responsible or\n    liable for any business, employment, hiring and/or salary decisions, for\n    whatever reason made, made by you.\n\u00a0\n5.4 damage limitations, allocations of liability and\n    equitable relief.\n\u00a0\n(a) you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of\n    the talent network, the internet generally, and the documents you post or\n    access and for your conduct on and off the talent network.\n\u00a0\n(b) in no event shall automotohr (or any of its officers,\n    directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or advertisers),\n    be liable for any non-direct damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,\n    incidental and consequential damages, lost profits, or damages resulting from\n    lost data, lost employment opportunity, or business interruption) resulting\n    from or arising under or in connection with services or the use or access to,\n    or the inability to use or access, the talent network and/or any document,\n    whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and\n    whether or not automotohr is advised of the possibility of such damages. this\n    section shall not apply to any payment and indemnification obligations\n    described herein.\n\u00a0\n(c) because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the\n    exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,\n    the limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph may not apply to you. if\n    any are held inapplicable or unenforceable for any reason, then automotohr    maximum liability to you for any non-direct type of damages shall be limited to\n    u.s. $200.00 in the aggregate.\n\u00a0\n(d) in no event shall automotohr (or any of its officers,\n    directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or\n    advertisers), be liable for any direct damages in excess in the aggregate of\n    us$200.00.\n\u00a0\n(e) due to the nature of this agreement, in addition to\n    money damages, you agree that automotohr will be entitled to equitable relief\n    upon a breach of this agreement by you.\n\u00a0\n5.5 user\n        authentication. because user authentication on the internet is difficult, automotohr cannot and does not confirm that each user is\n    who they claim to be. because automotohr does not and\n    cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings or control the behavior of\n    participants on the talent network, in the event that you have a dispute with\n    one or more users, you release automotohr from\n    claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect)\n    of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected,\n    disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such\n    disputes.\n\u00a0\n5.6 california\n        residents. if you are a california resident, you waive california civil\n    code section 1542, which says: \"a general release does not extend to\n    claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor\n    at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have\n    materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.\"\n\u00a0\n6. links to other\n        sites. the talent network may contain links to third party web sites. these\n    links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by automotohr of the contents on such third-party web sites. automotohr is not responsible for the content of linked\n    third-party sites and does not make any representations regarding the content\n    or accuracy of materials on such third-party web sites. if you decide to access\n    linked third-party web sites, you do so at your own risk.\n\u00a0\n7. amendments to this\n        agreement and changes to the talent network. automotohr\n    may revise these terms and conditions at any time by updating this page.\n    changes will be binding on you on the date they are posted on the talent\n    network (or as otherwise stated in any notice of such changes). any use of the\n    talent network will be considered acceptance by you of the then-current terms\n    and conditions (including any exhibits thereto) contained on such talent\n    network. if at any time you find the terms and conditions unacceptable, you\n    must not use the applicable talent network any longer. any new or different\n    terms supplied by you are specifically rejected by automotohr\n    unless automotohr agrees to them in a signed writing\n    specifically including those new or different terms. automotohr\n    may change the talent network at any time.\n\u00a0\n8. indemnity. you\n    agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless automotohr\n    (and its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries,\n    affiliates,

submitted\n    information and has no obligation to screen communications or information in\n    advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring documents posted by\n    users. if notified by a user of a document which allegedly does not conform to\n    these terms and conditions, automotohr may\n    investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole\n    discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such document. automotohr has no liability or responsibility to users for\n    performance or nonperformance of such activities. automotohr\n    may take any action with respect to user submitted information that it deems\n    necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion.\n\u00a0\n5.2 no endorsements\n    by automotohr. nothing on the talent

servers are free of computer viruses or other harmful mechanisms. if your\n    use of the talent network results directly or indirectly in the need for servicing\n    or replacing equipment or data, automotohr is not responsible for those costs.\n\u00a0\n(ii) automotohr makes no representations or guarantees\n    regarding the truthfulness, accuracy, legality, completeness, timeliness or\n    reliability of any documents posted by users, or of any other form of\n    communication engaged in by users. documents may contain inaccuracies or\n    typographical errors. you agree that any reliance on documents posted by users,\n    or on any other form of communication with users, will be at your own risk.\n\u00a0\n(iii) automotohr makes no representations or guarantees\n    regarding

by you.\n\u00a0\n5.4 damage limitations, allocations of liability and\n    equitable relief.\n\u00a0\n(a) you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of\n    the talent network, the internet generally, and the documents you post or\n    access and for your conduct on and off the talent network.\n\u00a0\n(b) in no event shall automotohr (or any of its officers,\n    directors,

damages, lost profits, or damages resulting from\n    lost data, lost employment opportunity, or business interruption) resulting\n    from or arising under or in connection with services or the use or access to,\n    or the inability to use or access, the talent network and/or any document,\n    whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and\n    whether or not automotohr is advised of the possibility of such damages. this\n    section shall not apply to any payment and indemnification obligations\n    described herein.\n\u00a0\n(c) because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the\n    exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,\n    the limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph may not apply to you. if\n

relief\n    upon a breach of this agreement by you.\n\u00a0\n5.5 user\n        authentication. because user authentication on the internet is difficult, automotohr cannot and does not confirm that each user is\n    who they claim to be. because automotohr does not and\n    cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings or control the behavior of\n    participants on the talent network, in the event that you have a dispute with\n    one or more users, you release automotohr from\n    claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect)\n    of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected,\n    disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such\n    disputes.\n\u00a0\n5.6 california\n        residents. if you are a california resident, you waive california civil\n    code section 1542, which says: \"a general release does not extend to\n    claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor\n    at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have\n    materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.\"\n\u00a0\n6. links to other\n

stated in any notice of such changes). any use of the\n    talent network will be considered acceptance by you of the then-current terms\n    and conditions (including any exhibits thereto) contained on such talent\n    network. if at any time you find the terms and conditions unacceptable, you\n    must not use the applicable talent network any longer. any new or different\n    terms supplied by you are specifically rejected by automotohr\n    unless automotohr agrees to them in a signed writing\n    specifically including those new or different terms. automotohr\n    may change the talent network at any time.\n\u00a0\n8. indemnity. you\n    agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless automotohr\n    (and its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries,\n    affiliates,

building an advanced machine learning platform focused on predicting consumer behaviour on behalf of retailers. over the past three years, we have been able to connect with over 150,000 retail point of sale locations in 10 countries to create a database of over $100 billion in first party retail transactional data. and these numbers keep on growing!\nwho we are looking for:\nall aspects of building data science products are familiar to you: wrangling with messy or missing data, feature engineering, prototyping statistical/machine learning models, and coding up an appropriate solution that\u2019s fit for production. you are driven by the thought of solving real-world business problems and a practical mindset using the more appropriate technique for the problem, whether that be a simple linear regression or a lstm. \u00a0\nyou\u2019re a quick learner able to adapt to a myriad of challenges that come up in a data science project whether that be digging into a dataset to perform feature engineering, zooming into details of scikit-learn algorithm implementation, or designing an experiment to test the efficacy of a new collaborative filtering algorithm. \u00a0you\u2019re fluent in python, have run more sql queries than you would like to admit, and have hands-on experience with big data technologies such as spark and hadoop. \u00a0you get the frequentist vs. bayesian jokes on xkcd (and love explaining it), can comfortably explain the difference between a random forest and gradient boosted trees, and are always willing to get your hands dirty analyzing the minutiae in the data.\nas an effective communicator, you\u2019ll collaborate with other like minded individuals to come up with creative solutions to our retail data science problems interfacing across all departments and teams. \u00a0your primary focus is on providing meaningful impact to our clients, which requires asking the right questions, distilling the problem and coming up with creative solutions.\nrequirements:\n\n\nmasters/phd degree or equivalent in computer science, engineering, mathematics or related field\n\n\nproficiency with various machine learning & statistical techniques\n\n\nproficiency in python or other data manipulation or analysis languages; software development experience is a plus\n\n\nexperience working with relational data via sql; experience with big data technologies such as spark and hadoop a plus\n\n\nability to work in *nix environments\n\n\nwho we are:\nnamed as one of deloitte\u2019s fast 50 2015 companies to watch, we are a rapidly growing venture-backed startup with a group of intellectually curious people who are passionate about making a big splash in the world of retail. we offer competitive compensation including equity options - we want all rubikrew to own part of the company. you will have a full health benefits package including extended health care, dental, vision, etc. lunch is catered monday to thursday so you won\u2019t have to worry about packing a lunch! healthy snacks and drinks are also provided to keep you energized. additionally, we offer a personal development budget that you are free to use for professional development or as a fitness allowance.\nrubikloud welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part

simple linear regression or a lstm. \u00a0\nyou\u2019re a quick learner able to adapt to a myriad of challenges that come up in a data science project whether that be digging into a dataset to perform

data.\nas an effective communicator, you\u2019ll collaborate with other like minded individuals to come up with creative solutions to our retail data science problems interfacing across all
