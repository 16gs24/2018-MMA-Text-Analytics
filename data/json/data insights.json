insights.\nlike most tech companies, adlib started small, in response to a problem our co-founders experienced as business leaders. they recognized a need for rapidly generated solutions to leverage the value in unstructured data. but unlike most tech companies, those original co-founders continue to be directly involved in the daily operations of the company as ceo, vp r&d and vp customer success. they've built adlib on three pillars of strength that measure our success:\n\nproduct innovation. we build up from our roots, improvising - adlibbing - solutions to client document and data

actually live them. how do we know this? a significant portion of our team has been here for longer than 10 years. in the tech industry, that's rare. we have people who leave and come back because they miss the culture and our team spirit.\nbut, having said that, we aren't perfect at everything. we're continuously working on change management - we've lost count of how many whiteboards we have. we don't have all of the processes we'd like to, but that means that this is the place to get your hands dirty, come up with your own processes and work without a net.\nwhile this might be common in silicon valley, in the suburbs of toronto, it's rare and greatly appreciated to have an open-vacation policy and to promote employee wellness. we have massage therapist days, badminton, baseball, fresh fruit in the lunchroom and fitness membership reimbursement. our burlington, ontario location translates to minimal commute time and maximum family time and productivity time. if you aren't stuck in traffic, worried about being late for a professional or personal commitment, life is just less stressful and work is more enjoyable.\nadlib software is revolutionizing the way organizations

content management. we've displaced gorillas in the market with a focus on customer service and success. we are adding to our suite of offerings, building a new product with a unique approach to data insights.\nlike most tech companies, adlib started small, in response to a problem our co-founders experienced as business leaders. they recognized a need for rapidly generated solutions to leverage the value in unstructured data. but unlike most tech companies, those original co-founders continue to be directly involved in the daily operations of the company as ceo, vp r&d and vp customer success. they've built adlib on three pillars of strength that measure our success:\n\nproduct innovation. we build up from our roots, improvising - adlibbing - solutions to client document and data management problems.\ncustomer relationships. we have a dedicated focus on creating a positive customer experience that stands out from everyone else.\ntruly engaged and passionate team. that's where you come in.\n\nwho you are\nyou are obsessed with solving big data problems and determining value of dark data. you want to be fully immersed in an r&d role where you can push the boundaries of knowledge and innovate new solutions to be patented. you are looking for a role where you can leverage your knowledge and our technologies to give meaning and make decisions around unstructured data. you want to use research, natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve data science challenges. you want an opportunity to drive forward the creation of algorithms that will become part of the adlib elevate platform and have a significant impact on thousands of organizations across the globe. there are very few roles like this one out there.\nour new jr. data scientist will work with:\n\nbig data. collect, ingest, store and analyze large datasets from structured and unstructured data. transform and convert unstructured dataset into structured data products.\nbest practices. identify and evaluate standardized methods, best practices, models and algorithms to solve the problems.\nmachine learning. research and develop new machine learning

actually live them. how do we know this? a significant portion of our team has been here for longer than 10 years. in the tech industry, that's rare. we have people who leave and come back because they miss the culture and our team spirit.\nbut, having said that, we aren't perfect at everything. we're continuously working on change management - we've lost count of how many whiteboards we have. we don't have all of the processes we'd like to, but that means that this is the place to get your hands dirty, come up with your own processes and work without a net.\nwhile this might be common in silicon valley, in the suburbs of toronto, it's rare and greatly appreciated to have an open-vacation policy and to promote employee wellness. we have massage therapist days, badminton, baseball, fresh fruit in the lunchroom and fitness membership reimbursement. our burlington, ontario location translates to minimal commute time and maximum family time and productivity time. if you aren't stuck in traffic, worried about being late for a professional or personal commitment, life is just less stressful and work is more enjoyable.\nadlib software is revolutionizing the way organizations think about their content, join us to be part of that change. apply now or follow us on\u00a0twitter,\u00a0facebook\u00a0or\u00a0linkedin.\nadlib seeks to inspire and nurture the human spirit - we understand that each person brings a distinct life experience to the table. embracing diversity not only enhances our work culture but drives business success. adlib encourages applications from everybody, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n

& insights team. together, we\u2019re responsible for all of the reporting, analytics, data flows, visualization, machine learning and related business intelligence operations within the company. \u00a0success in this role requires four related components. \u00a0the first is that at your core, you are curious. \u00a0you live for going down the rabbit hole. chasing mysteries, finding quirks, and peeling back all the layers. \u00a0finding new questions to you is almost as fun as answering them, but answer them you do, with solid statistical proof displayed in clear language and compelling visualizations. the second requirement is an ability and interest in understanding our business. \u00a0\u00a0we\u2019ve got lots of data, but it\u2019s not going to turn itself into information, and you can\u2019t help with that unless you understand what the numbers mean. \u00a0learning about our business will be made both easy and fun by your deep and passionate love of the internet. \u00a0you believe it\u2019s powerfully transformative and even, perhaps, the greatest thing ever. \u00a0you can\u2019t wait to be a part of helping tucows make the internet even more awesome. the third component is that you really, for serious\u00ad, love math and coding. your arsenal of algorithms is both deep and broad. \u00a0you know precisely which tool is right for the job and you also know why.the last, but certainly not least, component is the ability and willingness to continuously learn about new technologies. the data science ecosystem is a fast-evolving beast. newer and more powerful tools are released all the time. you are a data scientist who is constantly updating their knowledge of data science state-of-the-art.if you have these four qualities, you\u2019ll find tucows

& insights team. together, we\u2019re responsible for all of the reporting, analytics, data flows, visualization, machine learning and related business intelligence operations within the company. \u00a0success in this role requires four related components. \u00a0the first is that at your core, you are curious. \u00a0you live for going down the rabbit hole. chasing mysteries, finding quirks, and peeling back all the layers. \u00a0finding new questions to you is almost as fun as answering them, but answer them you do, with solid statistical proof displayed in clear language and compelling visualizations. the second requirement is an ability and interest in understanding our business. \u00a0\u00a0we\u2019ve got lots of data, but it\u2019s not going to turn itself into information, and you can\u2019t help with that unless you understand what the numbers mean. \u00a0learning about our business will be made both easy and fun by your deep and passionate love of the internet. \u00a0you believe it\u2019s powerfully transformative and even, perhaps, the greatest thing ever. \u00a0you can\u2019t wait to be a part of helping tucows make the internet even more awesome. the third component is that you really, for serious\u00ad, love math and coding. your arsenal of algorithms is both deep and broad. \u00a0you know precisely which tool is right for the job and you also know why.the last, but certainly not least, component is the ability and willingness to continuously learn about new technologies. the data science ecosystem is a fast-evolving beast. newer and more powerful tools are released all the time. you are a data scientist who is constantly updating their knowledge of data science state-of-the-art.if you have these four qualities, you\u2019ll find tucows an exciting, ambitious and supportive environment in which to do impactful data science work. \u00a0main purpose of position:responsible for the provision of information to drive business decision

word \u201cswelling\u201d. our model, built from a very large training sample, tells us that the only two types of injuries that can produce the word \u201cswelling\u201d are \u201cburn\u201d, which occurs in 1 out of 10 observations, and \u201cbruise\u201d, which occurs in 1 out of 100 observations. a \u201cbruise\u201d observation has a 30% chance of generating the word \u201cswelling\u201d, while \u201cburn\u201d has only a 5% chance of generating the word \u201cswelling. without any other information, is the new observation with the word \u201cswelling\u201d more likely to be a burn or a bruise? what is the probability of either?*\n \n\nsuppose out of a list of new unlabelled description observations, 6 of them have the word \u201cswelling\u201d in them. what is the probability that

word \u201cswelling\u201d. our model, built from a very large training sample, tells us that the only two types of injuries that can produce the word \u201cswelling\u201d are \u201cburn\u201d, which occurs in 1 out of 10 observations, and \u201cbruise\u201d, which occurs in 1 out of 100 observations. a \u201cbruise\u201d observation has a 30% chance of generating the word \u201cswelling\u201d, while \u201cburn\u201d has only a 5% chance of generating the word \u201cswelling. without any other information, is the new observation with the word \u201cswelling\u201d more likely to be a burn or
