Gathering Data
--------------

-   Beautiful Soup & Selenium were used in Python to access [Indeed](https://www.indeed.ca/jobs?q=analytics&l=Toronto&start=10 "Indeed:Analytics Jobs in Toronto") and scrape unsponsored job titles, companies, and postings
-   `later number` unique jobs were scraped from the search terms: `analytics`,`etc`....
-   Jobs were passed from Python to R using [Feather](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/03/29/feather/ "Feather: A Fast On-Disk Format for Data Frames for R and Python, powered by Apache Arrow")

``` r
data <- read_feather("results_analytics_Toronto+ON.feather")
head(data,1)
```
